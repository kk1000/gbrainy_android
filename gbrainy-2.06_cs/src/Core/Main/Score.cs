			How the game session is scored

			* The results are added to the games and scores arrays where we store the results for
			  the different game types (verbal, logic, etc)
			* We apply a SessionScoreFormula function that balances the total result with the number of
	  		  games played (is not the same 100% games won playing 2 than 10 games) and the difficulty

			The final result is a number from 0 to 100
