Tools currently used to build gbrainy:

* GameXmlToGetString.cs - Use to extract plural strings from games.xml into GetString calls to make possible to localize them

Experimental tools:

* GamesStatistics.cs - Gets statistics on the built-in games
* GameXmlGetString.cs - Experimental conversor from Xml described games into C# (to statically compile them) 
* TranslationsChecker.cs - Checks for errors in translation files
